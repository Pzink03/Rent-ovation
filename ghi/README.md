Rent-ovation - One stop for property managers and renters to manage their properties.

## Design

## Intended Market

We are targeting property managers and renters who are looking for a streamlined user experience to manage their properties. They will be able to manage/book appointments and rental payments.

## Functionality

Visitors to the site will have the option t learn more about the site through our about page that will also contain our user testimonials.
Visitors to the site will be able to choose what type of user they want to sign up as.

- If the user signs up as a landlord they will be able to add an manage all of their properties unique to their account.
- The landlord will be get alerts when rent for a property is past due or if the tenant schedules an appointment with them.
- The landlord will be able to view a list of all his completed appointments.
- If the user signs up as a Tenant they will have their property linked to their account.

- The Tenant can also schedule appointments with their landlord

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
